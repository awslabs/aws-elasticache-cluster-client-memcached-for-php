# Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client

Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client is used to connect to ElastiCache for Memcached clusters. This extension uses Amazon ElastiCache fork of libmemcached library to provide API for communicating with ElastiCache servers. Our changes are based on open-source memcached extension v.2.1.0 from https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached. This code branch is compatible with PHP 5.x. Other PHP versions (including PHP 7.x) are not supported. 
This client library is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://aws.amazon.com/apache-2-0/).

# Building

To compile this package to generate the PHP Memcached extension, do the following set of steps (verified on Amazon Linux 201503 AMI):

0) Install the required dependencies. 

> sudo yum install php php-devel zlib-devel php-pear

1) Checkout and compile the dependency package aws-elasticache-cluster-client-libmemcached via https://github.com/awslabs/aws-elasticache-cluster-client-libmemcached

Note: if you want to compile the PHP-memcached client with igbinary support, run the following additional command to install igbinary

> sudo pecl install igbinary

2) Run the following set of commands under the current directory:

> phpize

> ./configure --with-libmemcached-dir=&lt;path to libmemcached build directory&gt; &lt;other options&gt;

For igbinary support, specify "--enable-memcached-igbinary" in "other options".

Note: you can statically link the libmemcached library into the PHP binary so it can be ported across various Linux platforms. To do that, run the following command, otherwise proceed to "make" 

> sed -i "s#-lmemcached#\<libmemcached build directory\>/lib/libmemcached.a -lcrypt -lpthread -lm -lstdc++ -lsasl2#" Makefile

> make

> make install
